# Alien_Invasion_Game

## About the Game:

This is a 2D game that I will develop using Python programming language. It is a little interesting game about a ship that shoots down a bunch of aliens falling from the sky. In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player destroys all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.

## Instructions to Run the Game:

### First Step: 
The player Run the game and when the game window opens, the player the click on "Play" button. 
### Second Step: 
When the game has started the game window will be populated by a bunch of aliens, flowing down to the bottom of the game window. 
### Third Step: 
The player then controls the Ship which is located at the bottom of the game window using the left and right keyboard arrows to move left or right and use the space bar button on the keyboard to fire bullets to the Aliens. 
### Fourth Step: 
The game changes in speed as the player destroys all the Aliens, and if the Alien touches the Ship or the bottom of the game window a new game starts up until four chances given to the player then the game is Over!!!

### Fifth Step:

To Quit the Game press "q" button on the keyboard.

## Dependancies to Run the Game:

The are no dependancies to Run this project, other than the libraries like pygame and Sys that you need to install before developing the game.

## ScreenShoots of the Game:

Screenshoots of the Game while in motion are store on the folder called "Game ScreenShoots"

## Further Improvements:

Further improvements to the Game will follow, that includes adding score and points, adding sound to the game and more.
